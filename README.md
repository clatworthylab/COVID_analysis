# COVID_analysis
Collated scripts and data for Clatworthy Lab's contributions towards scRNAseq analyses for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19).

## Projects

1) **COVIDPBMC** - collaborative scRNAseq project between Ncl, Sanger/UCL and UCAM. Our lab was in charge of the B cell analysis.
	The BCR airr files are available in this repository:
	[scbcr_airr.tsv.bz2](scbcr_airr.tsv.bz2)

1) **COVID_collab_Liu2021_Cell** - scBCRseq analysis for Dr. John Tsang's team at NIH (https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867421001689).

1) **COVID_NALT** - Clatworthy lab scRNAseq project using paired NALT and blood samples over the COVID-19 disease course as a natural experiment into the 	effects of a viral stimulus on mucosal surface and secondary lymphoid responses.
